# Reminder_App (reminders)

it's a simple reminder app made with React-Native and Expo.
I have implemented few features like add or remove a reminder or check as completed task.
only left alert notification for time Reminder

for remove a reminder swipe reminder to left, a delete button will appear.

fell free to implement new features.
